## JUST - JSON Under Simple Transformation (XSLT equivalent for JSON)

XSLT is a very popular and simple way to transform an XML document to another. More and more applications have switches their data formats to JSON as it is more elegant and less bulkier of the two. However, there isn't a simple way to transform a JSON document into another without having to write some code. 

This projects demonstrates the use of **JUST.NET** library which implements **JUST** in .NET.

This library is also written by me can be pulled from the nuget repository and used in your project.
